## User Personas

She keeps meticulous notes of maintenance in case we ever want to re-sell big purchases (think car, tools, etc.). Tracks tasks that may repeat and/or may occur in the future such as "how to open the pool" and "when to re-paint the kid's tree-fort". 

**Calvin**, a tech-savvy young man in his mid to late 20s. Lives on his own and very into electronics, gaming, gadgets. Wants to keep track of his user manuals for all the different tech that he buys. Doesn't need to track for the house because he rents his apartment, but wants to stay organized for when he moves in the future.
