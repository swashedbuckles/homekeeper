## Overview

**HomeKeeper** is a service to organize home maintenance in a paperless age -- upload, search, and maintain manuals for products within your home. Add maintenance schedules and custom instructions. A digital three-ring binder for your household. 

## Problem Statement

Organizing household maintenance can be cumbersome -- collecting all the manuals in one place, making notes of maintenance schedules, keeping receipts, special instructions for how to restart one's furnace. Many households resort to a filing cabinet or three-ring binder to keep everything organized. This can be difficult to maintain, and even more difficult to search.

## Key Features & MVP Scope

- Document upload, categorization, and searching
- OCR integration to extract text from uploaded manuals 
- Maintenance scheduling with notification system
- Custom document creation with a rich text editor
- Mobile-responsive design for access while performing maintenance tasks
- Basic analytics for maintenance history

## Technical Architecture

###  Stack

#### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (demonstrates type safety and modern practices)
- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks for simpler state, Redux Toolkit for more complex global state
- **UI Components**: Either custom components or a lightweight library like Chakra UI or Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- **API Communication**: React Query for data fetching, caching, and state synchronization

#### Backend

- **API**: Node.js with Express or Fastify for a RESTful API
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, or Auth0/Firebase Auth if you prefer a service
- **Database**: MongoDB for document storage flexibility (great for storing varied manual formats)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage for manual PDFs/documents
- **Search**: Elasticsearch or MongoDB Atlas Search for powerful document searching

#### DevOps/Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify for frontend, Railway or Render for backend
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional, but good to showcase)
