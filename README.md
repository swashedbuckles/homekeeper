## Executive Summary

**HomeKeeper** is a service to organize home maintenance in a paperless age -- upload, search, and maintain manuals for products within your home. Add maintenance schedules and custom instructions. A digital three-ring binder for your household. 

## Problem Statement

Organizing household maintenance can be cumbersome -- collecting all the manuals in one place, making notes of maintenance schedules, keeping receipts, special instructions for how to restart one's furnace. Many households resort to a filing cabinet or three-ring binder to keep everything organized. This can be difficult to maintain, and even more difficult to search.

## User Personas

**Alison**, Head of household with a family of 4, who wants to keep track of the manuals for household purchases, but doesn't want to waste space in the household. She keeps meticulous notes of maintenance in case we ever want to re-sell big purchases (think car, tools, etc.). Tracks tasks that may repeat and/or may occur in the future such as "how to open the pool" and "when to re-paint the kid's tree-fort". 

**Calvin**, a tech-savvy young man in his mid to late 20s. Lives on his own and very into electronics, gaming, gadgets. Wants to keep track of his user manuals for all the different tech that he buys. Doesn't need to track for the house because he rents his apartment, but wants to stay organized for when he moves in the future. 

## Key Features & MVP Scope

- Document upload, categorization, and searching
- OCR integration to extract text from uploaded manuals 
- Maintenance scheduling with notification system
- Custom document creation with a rich text editor
- Mobile-responsive design for access while performing maintenance tasks
- Basic analytics for maintenance history

## Technical Architecture

###  Stack

#### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (demonstrates type safety and modern practices)
- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks for simpler state, Redux Toolkit for more complex global state
- **UI Components**: Either custom components or a lightweight library like Chakra UI or Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- **API Communication**: React Query for data fetching, caching, and state synchronization

#### Backend

- **API**: Node.js with Express or Fastify for a RESTful API
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, or Auth0/Firebase Auth if you prefer a service
- **Database**: MongoDB for document storage flexibility (great for storing varied manual formats)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage for manual PDFs/documents
- **Search**: Elasticsearch or MongoDB Atlas Search for powerful document searching

#### DevOps/Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify for frontend, Railway or Render for backend
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional, but good to showcase)
